# C++ School Labs (Grade 11 & 12)

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains all the C++ experiments and projects I worked on during my high school years (Grades 11 & 12). These include fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, and small projects that were part of my curriculum. The purpose of this repo is to preserve my early coding journey and help others who might find these experiments useful for learning.
